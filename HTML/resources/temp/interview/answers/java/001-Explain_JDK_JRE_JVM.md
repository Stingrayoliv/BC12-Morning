# Explain JDK, JRE and JVM


The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. 

It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java),a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

JRE includes JVM.

A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.
